# Software Testing Agent
Author : Brian Cazares

Github : https://github.com/cazaresb/Software_Testing_Agent

## Overview
An intelligent agent (using MCP) that automatically generates, executes, and iterates on test cases to achieve maximum code coverage. This project combines modern AI-assisted development with traditional software engineering practices.

### Features:
* Built on Node.js, Maven and Junit for testing.
* JaCoCo Coverage report artifact creation.
* Model Context Protocol servers for development automation.
* Github Workflow for automatic creation and upload of artifacts.
* Custom automation tools for software development workflows: "**Specification-Based Testing Generator**", "**AI Code Review Agent**"

This project aims to speed up the development process w/ strong software engineering principles, ultimately applicable to real-world development scenarios, with the help of the software testing agent.

As a small demo, this repository contains a run on the **Stock_Market_Exchange** repository to generate tests with rigorous depth and maximum coverage. This repository can be found here (INSERT LINK).

## Install
* For the Model Context Protocol, FastMCP is used. You may view the install instructions at :Link:
## Goal:
Implement this project to create tests for my stock_market_exchange repository.

## Extensions
